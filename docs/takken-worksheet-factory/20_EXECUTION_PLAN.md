# 宅建 Worksheet Factory — EXECUTION PLAN

This plan is subordinate to `00_MASTER_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and works with `30_QUESTION_AND_QA_SPEC.md`. Phase 4 is additionally governed by `40_POWER_KNOWLEDGE_PRINT_APP_SPEC.md`.

## Phase 0 — foundation
- [x] Portable implementation under `qualifications/takken/`
- [x] 2026 exam year / `2026-04-01` law cutoff
- [x] Structured unit model and shared renderer
- [x] Deterministic seeded cloze and A4 print path
- [x] Verified-only public catalog and automated validation
- [x] Canonical question-generation / solve-all QA specification

## Phase 1 — ordered unit generation
- [x] All 90 canonical unit datasets generated in fixed order.
- [x] All remain unpublished until independently verified.

## Phase 2 — four-choice question generation
- [x] Stable-ID four-choice questions generated from all independently testable core facts.
Final totals: 90/90 units, 163/163 core facts, 163 generated questions.

## Phase 3 — solve-all independent validation
COMPLETE. Final totals: checked 163 / verified 163 / needs_revision 0 / rejected 0 / pending 0 / `validation_complete: true`.

## Phase 4 — Power宅建 knowledge / print / app integration
ACTIVE. Phase 3 completion gate is satisfied. Canonical specification: `40_POWER_KNOWLEDGE_PRINT_APP_SPEC.md`.

### 4.1 Concept inventory
- [x] Final inventory: 113 concepts in `qualifications/takken/data/power-concepts.js`.

### 4.2 Canonical knowledge items
- [ ] Decompose every concept into atomic `knowledge_items` with stable IDs, claims, conditions, exceptions, importance, `2026-04-01` cutoff and primary sources.
- [ ] Map existing verified questions only where they genuinely test the knowledge item; missing evidence remains a Phase 4.3 deficit.

Latest checkpoint:
- [x] `takken-concept-simultaneous-performance`: 2 verified atomic items from Civil Code Article 533 / canonical unit 47. The model separates the ordinary right to refuse one's own performance until the counterparty tenders performance from the statutory exception where the counterparty obligation is not yet due. Existing verified `takken-q-47-001` directly tests only the refusal-until-tender principle. The not-due exception remains an explicit Phase 4.3 coverage deficit.

Current Phase 4.2 totals: 60/113 modeled concepts, 319 verified knowledge items, 64 existing verified questions mapped, 238 explicit question-coverage gaps.

Exact continuation: `takken-concept-risk-allocation`, source unit `risk-simultaneous-performance`. Preserve all 238 explicit deficits and map existing verified questions only to knowledge they genuinely test. Do not start Phase 4.3 yet.

### 4.3 Fifty-question drill expansion
- [ ] Target 50 verified four-choice questions per concept, reusing verified existing questions and generating only the deficit.
- [ ] Reject superficial number/name/template swaps.

### 4.4 Question-first QA and explanation completion
- [ ] Independently solve every newly generated question before verified status.

### 4.5 Explanation-print generation
- [ ] Generate study / worksheet / answer only from verified question/knowledge data.

### 4.6 Bidirectional coverage validator
- [ ] Enforce Question -> Print and Print -> Question 100% knowledge coverage.

### 4.7 App review integration
- [ ] Expose concept / knowledge item IDs and weak-item review linkage.

## publication invariant
Only independently verified material may be published. A verified knowledge item without a verified question mapping remains an explicit Phase 4.3 deficit and does not satisfy publication coverage.
